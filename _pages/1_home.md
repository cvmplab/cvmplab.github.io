The **Computer Vision and Machine Perception (CVMP) Lab** at the University of Technology Nuremberg develops foundational principles for the next generation of AI systems that can understand the world **spatio-temporally and semantically** with the goal to move beyond purely statistical pattern recognition toward models that reason about **geometry, motion, and meaning** in a unified way. The lab is headed by [**Prof. Dr. Eddy Ilg**](/eddy-ilg/), known for seminal contributions to computer vision and for prior work on AR technology at Meta. The lab’s research is supported by an **ERC Starting Grant**—one of Europe’s most competitive research funding programs.
