The CVMP Lab develops foundational principles for the next generation of AI systems that can understand the world **spatio-temporally and semantically**. Our goal is to move beyond purely statistical pattern recognition toward models that reason about **geometry, motion, and meaning** in a unified way. 

To achieve this, we bring together **3D computer vision**, **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **robotics**, with a particular focus on structured world representations derived from dynamic visual observations. Rather than relying solely on large-scale correlations between images and text, we investigate **explicit, lightweight abstractions of physical scenes** that enable robust generalization, reasoning, and interaction with the real world.

The lab is headed by [**Prof. Dr. Eddy Ilg**](/eddy-ilg/), known for seminal contributions to computer vision—most notably in optical flow—and for prior work on AR technology at Meta. The lab’s research is supported by an **ERC Starting Grant**—one of Europe’s most competitive research funding programs—for the project **“4DLang: Establishing a Spatio-Temporal Language for Scene Representation,”** which introduces a new paradigm for grounding language in structured, geometric, and temporal representations of the world. An overview is shown in the following:

While unsupervised learning in computer vision alone provides only limited semantic abstraction, language, on the other hand, provides high-level semantic abstraction but lacks spatio-temporal reasoning. The goal of 4D lang is to unite both modalities into a new language that consists of 3D primitives with attached neural features (indicated by color) representing geometry, materials and physical properties, semantics, behaviour, and possible interactions. Overall, our research aims to advance core AI capabilities with impact across **content understanding and generation, augmented reality and AI assistants, robotics, and autonomous driving**. An overview of the key research areas is provided in the following: 

## 3D Reconstruction

## Neural Mesh Models for Object Representation

## Multi-Object Tracking 

## Vision-Language Models 

## Incremental Learning
