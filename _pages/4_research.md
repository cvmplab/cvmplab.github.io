The **Computer Vision and Machine Perception (CVMP) Lab** at the University of Technology Nuremberg develops foundational principles for the next generation of AI systems that can understand the world **spatio-temporally and semantically**. Our goal is to move beyond purely statistical pattern recognition toward models that reason about **geometry, motion, and meaning** in a unified way. 

To achieve this, we bring together **3D computer vision**, **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **robotics**, with a particular focus on structured world representations derived from dynamic visual observations. Rather than relying solely on large-scale correlations between images and text, we investigate **explicit, lightweight abstractions of physical scenes** that enable robust generalization, reasoning, and interaction with the real world.

The lab is headed by [**Prof. Dr. Eddy Ilg**](/eddy-ilg/), known for seminal contributions to computer vision—most notably in optical flow—and for prior work on AR technology at Meta. The lab’s research is supported by an **ERC Starting Grant**—one of Europe’s most competitive research funding programs—for the project **“4DLang: Establishing a Spatio-Temporal Language for Scene Representation,”** which introduces a new paradigm for grounding language in structured, geometric, and temporal representations of the world.

Our research aims to advance core AI capabilities with impact across **content understanding and generation, augmented reality and AI assistants, robotics, and autonomous driving**. An overview of the key research areas is provided in the following: 

## Neural Mesh Models for Object Representation

## Multi-Object Tracking 

## Vision-Language Models 

## 3D Reconstruction
