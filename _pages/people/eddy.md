I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Freiburg and am well known for my work on optical flow. It is fundamental for many applications, such as robotics and autonomous driving, and led to a paradigm shift in the field. I am also known for my work in related areas on the estimation of disparities, motion and occlusion boundaries, occlusions, and uncertainties. Please take a look at my [thesis](http://www.eddy-ilg.net/Eddy_Ilg_PhD_Thesis.pdf).

Previously I worked at Meta Reality Labs in the US on project [LiveMaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTa8zn0RNVM), which aims to build a complete machine perception stack for augmented reality ranging from hardware to mapping and localization, as well as 3D scene understanding and photorealistic 3D reconstruction. This work gifted me with a very broad perspective on AI and an understanding of the involved challenges.

I became a professor at Saarland University in June 2022 and started the CVMP lab. I became a full professor at UTN in August 2024 and the lab moved to Nuremberg. UTN presents the ideal environment for AI research with a modern perspective and a beautiful [city](https://www.planetware.com/2030782/nuremberg-germany-major-tourist-attractions-add-to-itinerary/). My current research interests lie in bringing AI systems to the next level and using deep learning in combination with 3D computer vision, computer graphics, and NLP. My vision is to combine research from these areas to build AI systems that are not rigid and can evolve over time.

As a fun fact, during high school, I wrote an operating system and won the prize for the best work in software engineering at the German young researcher’s federal contest. I am generally a very curious and creative person. During my studies, I was supported by a scholarship from the German Academic Scholarship Foundation for extraordinarily talented students with a vast horizon. Beyond, I am area chair for BMVC, CVPR, ECCV and NeurIPS, and associate editor for TPAMI.

A strong team atmosphere is very important to me and I pay special attention to a vibrant discussion and collaboration culture in the lab with regular social events.
