We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher who wants to build the next generation of geometric reasoning and language-grounded 3D perception systems.

**What you'll do**
- Lead research on 3D reconstruction, scene understanding, or vision-language models for embodied agents.
- Collaborate with graduate students on experiments and publications.
- Help shape datasets and benchmarks that stress-test geometric priors and multimodal reasoning.

**What you bring**
- PhD in computer vision, robotics, machine learning, or a related area.
- Strong publication record in 3D CV or VLMs (e.g., NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ICRA).
- Proficiency with PyTorch/JAX and modern 3D/vision toolchains.

**How to apply**
- Email your CV and a short research statement to the email address below
