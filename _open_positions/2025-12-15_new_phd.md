We are looking for ambitious PhD students who want to build the next generation of geometric reasoning and language-grounded 3D perception systems.

**What you'll do**
- Research on 3D reconstruction, scene understanding, or vision-language models for embodied agents.

**What you bring**
- Strong Master's degree in computer vision, robotics, machine learning, or a related area.
- Strong publication record in 3D CV or VLMs (e.g., NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ICRA).
- Proficiency with PyTorch/JAX and modern 3D/vision toolchains.

**How to apply**
- Email your CV and a short research statement to the email address below
